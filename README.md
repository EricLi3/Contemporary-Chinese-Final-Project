# Contemporary-Chinese-Final-Project   Eric, Alex, and Daniel

Background:
The "Warm Room" project seeks to establish a proof-of-concept anonymous forum that fosters open discussions and supports mental health challenges within the Asian American community. By creating a safe and culturally sensitive space, this platform seeks to handle the unique mental health needs of Asian Americans and play a role in breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health, particularly in the Asian community.
Objectives:
-	Provide a Safe and Anonymous Space: Ensure the forum offers complete anonymity to encourage open and honest discussions about mental health.
-	Empower through Shared Stories: Encourage users to share personal stories of overcoming mental health challenges to inspire and empower others.
-	Implement strict moderation policies to ensure a safe and respectful space, free from harassment or harmful behavior.
-	Address Stigmas Surrounding Mental Health: Work towards breaking down cultural stigmas associated with mental health and promote understanding and acceptance.  <br>

Scope:
The project will contain a rudimentary online forum accessible to Asian Americans, ensuring a user-friendly interface, anonymity features, and cultural sensitivity. The platform will provide peer-to-peer forums, mental health resources, and an option to connect to mental health professionals. We plan to record a video demonstrating the product’s functionality and features. Later, we plan to communicate with MHACC and potentially add our website’s functionality to their platform.     <br>  <br>
